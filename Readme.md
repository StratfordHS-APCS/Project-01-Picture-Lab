# Project 01 - Picture Lab

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to teach you about, and give you some practice with, many topics in Java.  You will see 2d arrays, color objects, image manipulation, interfaces, and more.  This used to be a required lab for the AP test, where there would be questions specifically about this lab, but now it is just a good lab to do.  There are no questions on the AP test specifically about this lab.

## Instructions
The instructions and all the info you will need are in the "Picture Lab Student Guide.pdf" file included in your repo.  This file is also available for download from the College Board website.

There are no jUnit tests for this lab, but make sure any of your changes passes Checkstyle.  To test your code I will be downloading and running it.

## Helpful Resources
* [Arrays](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6009.html)
* [ArrayLists](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_arraylist_class.htm)

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.
* Edit the first line of the Readme.md file and put your username in both locations that say "username".  This is necessary if you want the badge at the top of the instructions to show red or green based on your most recent commit.

## Grading
* This will count as a project grade, but there will be various lab grades given throughout the duration of the project.

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
